I was sponsored by the University of Manchester Library to attend OpenCon 2017 in Berlin, Germany! You can read my guest post about my experience as an Astronomy Open Science Champion over on the [Library Research Plus blog](https://blog.research-plus.library.manchester.ac.uk/2017/12/04/an-astronomy-open-science-champions-experience-of-opencon2017/).
