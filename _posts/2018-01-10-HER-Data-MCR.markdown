I organise the Manchester chapter of [HER+Data](http://herplusdata.org/) - a meetup group which brings together women and all those who identify as women who work with and love data. Women have shared experiences and challenges that we face in male-dominated fields. As a thriving tech scene, Manchester only stands to benefit from gender balance in data roles - it is therefore important to build a network of women with whom to share our experiences, support each other and build confidence in ourselves to help combat gender inequality in tech.

[HER+Data](https://www.meetup.com/HER-Data) was founded in Dublin, Ireland (originally as XX+Data) by [Karen Church](https://twitter.com/karenchurch) with its kickoff meeting in May 2017. I began organising HER+Data MCR in July, and our [kickoff event](https://www.meetup.com/HER-Data-MCR/events/241920306/) was in September at the Manchester Science Park's brand new Bright Building. The group grew to 200+ members within the first 5 months and gained 2 co-organisers (we now have 550+ members). Our events are very kindly supported by [Evolution Recruitment Solutions](https://www.evolutionjobs.com/uk/) and our hosts vary from month to month (MSP, PwC and Rentalcars in 2017; Colony, MSP, the Federation, Hello Soda, Auto Trader UK, PwC, Valtech, Intechnica, Thoughtworks and KPMG in 2018).

To find out more information or join our community of women in data, check out our [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/HER-Data-MCR/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/herplusdatamcr) pages. Please get in touch if you are interested in giving a ~10 minute lightning talk, want to get involved, collaborate or host one of our events!
