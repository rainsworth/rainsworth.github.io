I’ve been lucky to represent the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics (JBCA) and the University of Manchester (UoM) at a number of open science conferences and events over the past few months — the first [Open Science Fair](http://www.opensciencefair.eu/) in Athens, the first [Open Research Forum](http://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/using-the-library/staff/research/open-research-forum/) here by the UoM Library, the 8th [Mozilla Festival](https://mozillafestival.org/) in London and the 4th [OpenCon](http://www.opencon2017.org/) in Berlin. Check out my original post on [Medium](https://medium.com/@rainsworth/reflections-on-the-open-science-conferences-of-2017-bfcaac8fdb0b) that includes brief reflections on each of these experiences.
